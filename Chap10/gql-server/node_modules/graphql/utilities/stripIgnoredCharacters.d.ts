/**
 * Strips characters that are not significant to the validity or execution
 * of a GraphQL document:
 *   - UnicodeBOM
 *   - WhiteSpace
 *   - LineTerminator
 *   - Comment
 *   - Comma
 *   - BlockString indentation
 *
 * Note: It is required to have a delimiter character between neighboring
 * non-punctuator tokens and this function always uses single space as delimiter.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that both input and output documents if parsed would result
 * in the exact same AST except for nodes location.
 *
 * Warning: It is guaranteed that this function will always produce stable results.
 * However, it's not guaranteed that it will stay the same between different
 * releases due to bugfixes or changes in the GraphQL specification.
 *
 * Query example:
 *
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * ```graphql
=======
>>>>>>> efb60b5ba318ea79afa9b17c06eb55420dda5343
 * query SomeQuery($foo: String!, $bar: String) {
 *   someField(foo: $foo, bar: $bar) {
 *     a
 *     b {
 *       c
 *       d
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * ```
 *
 * Becomes:
 *
 * ```graphql
 * query SomeQuery($foo:String!$bar:String){someField(foo:$foo bar:$bar){a b{c d}}}
 * ```
 *
 * SDL example:
 *
 * ```graphql

 * SDL example:
